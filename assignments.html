            <h3>Assignment 0: Initial Setup and add number script</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, I set up my development environment, created my portfolio website, and configured GitHub Pages for deployment. This was done to ensure all subsequent assignments are easily accessible online. I also included a add_number script in python in it.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 1: elevator super location :)</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, I analyzed the data collected from the cds elevators and calculate the best spot to wait for elevators to minimize the walking distance</p>

            <h3>Assignment 2: dynamic visualization of Kmeans :)</h3>
            <p>This project is an interactive web application that demonstrates the KMeans clustering algorithm. The primary objective is to explore how different initialization methods affect the clustering outcome, allowing users to visualize and interact with the algorithm step by step.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition :)</h3>
            <p>apply **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** as a preprocessing step to the **MNIST dataset** and train a **logistic regression classifier**. You will compare the model performance and training time when using different levels of SVD for dimensionality reduction.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 4: LSA  :)</h3>
            <p> To develop an interactive web application that implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search engine will take a user’s query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 5:  Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN :)</h3>
            <p> develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 6 : Linear regression Assumption</h3>
            <p> explore the impact of changing parameters on linear regression. The goal is to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking these settings, you’ll observe how randomness can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.</p>
